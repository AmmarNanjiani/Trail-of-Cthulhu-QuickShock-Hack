# Recovery
This section supersedes the **Recovery** section of *Trail of Cthulhu* (p. 80-82). Page number references are made for elements that are retained.

## Refreshing Points and Pushes
When points or pushes return to their starting values, we call that a refresh.

Pushes refresh to 2 per player at the start of each session.

General ability pools return to the value of their ratings at the start of each scenario.

This assumes a scenario that takes one or two sessions to complete. 

GMs may wish to build moments into longer scenarios, or ones in which significant leaps of time occur, which allow General ability points to refresh.

When a rule, card text, or scenario refers simply to a refresh, read that to mean a full refresh—the character’s pool returns to its full value

### Partial Refreshes
In some cases partial refreshes occur, in which the character regains a set number of points. These are marked with the number of points regained: so in a 2-point refresh, characters can top up their pools by 2 points.

Partial refreshes never allow characters to increase their pools above their ratings

### Refreshing Stability During A Session

Functions as described in the **Refreshing Stability During a Session** section in ToC (p. 79).

If using the alternative Pillars of Sanity rules (see [here](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/revised-pillars-of-sanity-rules/)), the difficulty of Psychological Triage is 6 minus the number of Pillars of Sanity the patient possesses.

The reward for Pulp Confidence can be a partial refresh instead.

### Recovering Sanity
Sanity refreshes can be rewarded at the end of a scenario, at the GM's discretion. Otherwise, it never comes back. 

"False Sanity" can be gained as described in the **Head Games** section in the ToC rulebook (p. 81).

### What Do Pool Points Represent?

Pool points are a literary abstraction, representing the way that characters get their own time in the spotlight in the course of an ensemble drama. When you do something remarkable, you expend a little bit of your spotlight time. More active players will spend their points sooner than less demonstrative ones, unless they carefully pick and choose their moments to shine.

Even when pools are empty, you still have a reasonable chance to succeed at a test, and you’ll always get the information you need to move forward in the case.

Pool points do not represent a resource, tangible or otherwise, in the game world. Players are aware of them, but characters are not. The team members’ ignorance of them is analogous to TV characters’ obliviousness to commercial breaks, the unwritten rules of scene construction, and the tendency of events to heat up during sweeps.

The characters do not literally get worse at doing things as the players expend points.

Instead, the players have used up their share of big spotlight moments they tied to their key abilities.

You may choose to depict this with narration—describing characters as drawn and exhausted when their Athletics pools ebb. 

But the system works just as well if you don’t worry about matching literal description to abstract resource.
