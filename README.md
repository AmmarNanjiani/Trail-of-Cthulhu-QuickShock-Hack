# Overview
The new QuickShock GUMSHOE debuted with The Yellow King RPG (YKRPG), I decided I would try to edit Trail of Cthulhu with the new mechanics introduced in QuickShock.

This document is meant to describe changes from the rules in the Trail of Cthulhu rulebook. If a mechanic isn’t addressed here, assume it works like the original rules.

Details about QuickShock GUMSHOE can be read in the [GUMSHOE SRD](https://site.pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/files/GUMSHOE_SRD_CC_3.pdf).

I’ve also created an implementation of these rules in FoundryVTT, which can be found here.

# Changes

Combat is completely changed to QuickShock style combat. 

As such, Health and Stability don’t go below 0 as they used to, and they no longer are a track of how close one is to death or insanity, respectively. The track is replaced by Injury and Shock Cards.

Investigative ability pools and investigative spends are no longer a thing. These are replaced by the Push system, where every investigator has 2 pushes they can spend. Pushes are refreshed at the beginning of every session. Alternatively, they can refresh according to the optional Drive rule elaborated on below.

Improvements come at 1 improvement point every 2 sessions or 1 scenario, at GM’s discretion. Award when Investigators have time to rest and improve.

General Abilities without build points allocated have a difficulty of +2.
