# Overview
The newest iteration of GUMSHOE, QuickShock GUMSHOE, debuted with *The Yellow King RPG* (YKRPG). I decided I would try to hack *Trail of Cthulhu* with the new mechanics introduced in QuickShock.

This document is meant to describe changes from the rules in the *Trail of Cthulhu* rulebook. The descriptions for new mechanics are reproduced from GUMSHOE SRD, occasionally with minor changes to suit *Trail of Cthulhu*. 

This is not a replacement for the original rules, but a supplement. You will need a copy of the original rules in order to use this hack. If a mechanic isn’t addressed here, assume it works like the original rules. 

[Purchase *Trail of Cthulhu* from Pelgrane Press](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/category/products/trail-of-cthulhu/).

I also have included some variant homebrew rules which I think improve the experience. I link to the original authors for those rules whenever they come up.

Details about QuickShock GUMSHOE can be read in the [GUMSHOE SRD](https://site.pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/files/GUMSHOE_SRD_CC_3.pdf).

I’ve also created an implementation QuickShock GUMSHOE in FoundryVTT, which can be found [here](https://github.com/AmmarNanjiani/QuickShock-GUMSHOE-FoundryVTT).


# QuickShock GUMSHOE
QuickShock GUMSHOE features a faster, entirely player-facing combat system. It keeps Stability and Health as general abilities, but rather than functioning as hit points, they give the players opportunities to resist taking Injury and Shock cards. These exert ongoing effects, and take the character out of play if they get too many of them at once.
