# Overview
The new QuickShock GUMSHOE debuted with The Yellow King RPG (YKRPG), I decided I would try to edit Trail of Cthulhu with the new mechanics introduced in QuickShock.

This document is meant to describe changes from the rules in the Trail of Cthulhu rulebook. If a mechanic isn’t addressed here, assume it works like the original rules.

Details about QuickShock GUMSHOE can be read in the [GUMSHOE SRD](https://site.pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/files/GUMSHOE_SRD_CC_3.pdf).

I’ve also created an implementation of these rules in FoundryVTT, which can be found [here](https://github.com/AmmarNanjiani/QuickShock-GUMSHOE-FoundryVTT).
