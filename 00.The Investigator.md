# The Investigator

This section is primarily about creating Investigators. New mechanics are referenced here, but not explained.

## Character Creation

1. Pick an Occupation.
2. Pick a Drive.
3. Pick Investigative Abilities.
4. Pick General Abilities.
5. Define Pillars of Sanity.


### Occupation
Use the list of Occupations from the Trail of Cthulhu rulebook (p. 9-18).

The bonus towards Occupational Abilities no longer exists in this hack. Use the list of Occupational Abilities as a short list for determining Investigative abilities and distributing General Build Points.

### Drive
Drive options are completely unchanged from the Trail of Cthulhu rulebook.

There are additional interesting options in the [Enchiridion of Elucidation](http://site.pelgranepress.com/trail/files/Enchiridion_of_Elucidation.pdf).

For the Keeper: the penalty for disobeying a soft or hard driver, as described in the ToC rulebook (p. 73), is not designed for Stability as it functions in QuickShock (more on this in the [General Abilities](#general-abilities) Section.). Therefore, I would advise ignoring the penalty. The reward for obeying a soft or hard driver can remain the same. If you still really want a penalty, Shock Cards could easily be designed for that purpose.

### Investigative Abilities

The method for defining Investigative abilities is revised. **Pushes** replace investigative spends as you may know them from standard GUMSHOE. You no longer allocate separate pool points to your various Investigative abilities. 

Your character has two **push points**, which can be spent to gain special benefits. More on this in **[Clues](01.Clues.md)**.

**Determining Investigative Abilities**
There are a couple of ways you can choose to do this, depending on your group.

Divide 36 by the number of players you have. Each player gets that many Investigative Abilities.

**Purist**: Cap this at six.

### General Abilities
Investigators are allowed **40** General build points for Purist play, or **44** for Pulp play.
General Abilities are now sorted into Physical/Focus/Presence as described in the SRD.

| Ability           | Sub-group|
|-------------------|----------|
| Athletics         | Physical |      
| Conceal           | Focus    |
| Disguise          | Presence |
| Driving           | Physical |
| Electrical Repair | Focus    |
| Explosives        | Focus    |
| Filch             | Focus    |
| Firearms          | Presence |
| First Aid         | Focus    |
| Fleeing           | Physical |
| Health            | Physical |
| Hypnosis          | Presence |
| Mechanical Repair | Focus    |
| Piloting          | Physical |
| Preparedness      | Presence |
| Psychoanalysis    | Presence |
| Riding            | Physical |
| Sanity            | Presence |
| Scuffling         | Physical |
| Sense Trouble     | Presence |
| Shadowing         | Focus    |
| Stability         | Presence |
| Stealth           | Focus    |
| Weapons           | Focus    |


In QuickShock, Stability and Health do not function the same way. Neither go below 0, and instead of being directly depleted by threats, you roll the ability to determine whether you take an **Injury** or **Shock Card**, for Health and Stability respectively. More on Injury and Shock cards in the relevant section.

The fighting abilities - Firearms, Scuffling, and Weapons - all have different penalties and bonuses, depending on what objective is defined in combat. Additionally, Tolls are paid from any combination of Athletics, a fighting ability, and Health. Check the [Fighting](04.Fighting.md) section for more details on these.

Note that due to the way Stability and Health function in QuickShock, they are not as vital. One should avoid having lower than 6 Stability rating, and try to have a 6 or higher in a fighting skill. 8 is generally the upper bound for any given skill rating bar Sanity. Party should try to have Psychoanalysis and First Aid available. 

Health, Sanity, and Stability now start at 0. An Investigator must invest at least one point into Sanity.

Sanity cannot be above 10.

If Fleeing is twice as high as Athletics, every following point allocated into Fleeing is doubled.

### Pillars of Sanity
*This is using an alternate set of rules for Pillars(see [here](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/revised-pillars-of-sanity-rules/)). If you want to do Pillars of Sanity with the standard ToC rules, ignore the following.*

For each partial set of 3 Sanity rating points, define one Pillar of Sanity. For 1-3 rating points, define 1 Pillar. For 4-6, define 2 Pillars. For 7+, define 3 Pillars.

There are four types of Pillars of Sanity:
* Moral Stance (e.g. family honour, truth of scientific knowledge, religion, etc)
* Treasured Symbol (e.g. a religious icon, a letter from a loved one)
* Person of Solace (e.g. a war comrade, a childhood friend, a family member)
* Place of Safety (e.g a family homestead, a favoured holiday spot)

You can only have a single Moral Stance and a single Place of Safety as your Pillar at any given time, however you are not required to have a number of any specific type.

Interacting with your Pillars can regain your Stability during a session.  See the section on Pillars of Sanity below for more details.

## Improvement
At the conclusion of each scenario, each character gets 1 Improvement point.

Players can spend Improvement points right away, or save them and spend them at any time.

To gain a new Investigative ability, a player spends 2 Improvement points and requests the approval of any player (if any) who already has it. As GM you may waive this requirement if the latter player is frequently unable to attend game sessions.

Players may add points to a General ability, including those rated at 0, gaining 1 rating point for each Improvement point spent.

## Character Replacement
When you lose a character due to physical death or psychic breakdown, create a new one using the standard steps given for the sequence youâ€™re playing.

When choosing your Investigative abilities, pick abilities no other player is using. Those could be the same ones your previous character had, or ones nobody picked. 

Purist: Spend the starting amount of build points on General abilities.

Pulp: Spend the number of build points y0ur departed character had, including both initial build points and Improvement points accumulated in play.
