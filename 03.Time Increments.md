# Time Increments
Certain GUMSHOE rules refer to various increments of time.

## Intervals
A new interval begins each time the group acquires a new core clue. When more than one core clue can be gained during a single scene, only the first clue counts as starting a new interval. When a rule says, for example, that something happens after two intervals pass, it means that the group must gather two core clues in separate scenes.

## Sessions
A session is the time spent playing one sitting of the game, whatever that happens to be.

If your sessions wildly differ from a baseline of three to four hours, you may find yourself adjusting the timing of effects keyed to sessions

## Scenarios
An effect that lasts until the end of a scenario concludes when the main answer to a mystery occurs, plus a perhaps a brief coda in which the team ties up loose ends, breaks terrible news to grieving relatives, make patrons aware of debts incurred or discharged, and so on.

Depending on how quickly the players crack the case at hand, a scenario might encompass multiple sessions, or last for one session only

## World Time
An hour, you will be shocked to learn, means an hour’s worth of time.

But wait!

An hour of **world time** refers to time as it unfolds for the characters. As in a piece of fiction, world time almost never elapses at the same rate for the characters as for the players and GM. A day might pass in a single sentence from the GM: “A day later, you find yourself at the inn.” Or you could spend minutes describing an action that in world time takes only a second or two.

## Game Time
An hour of **game time** refers to the real-world time you, the GM and players, spend at the gaming table (or lounging around in chairs in the den or whatever). 

The distinction between world and game time mostly matters when measuring the duration of Shock and Injury cards.
