# Fighting

This section supersedes the **Fighting** section of *Trail of Cthulhu* (p. 60-68). 

Though the characters spend most of their time solving mysteries, sometimes the answers they seek lead them into violent conflict. Fight scenes in unfold in the following stages.

## Fighting Quick Reference
    Players define objectives.
    GM determines Difficulty.
    GM prepares the Fight Tracker.
    Players declare spends.
    GM determines order of action.
    Participating characters take -1 Fighting and +1 to Tolls for each non-participating character.

    Next player in order: 
        Describes what the character is trying to do.
        Makes a fighting test.
        On a success, the player:
            Narrates a successful action.
            Either: 
                Pays the foes’ Toll.
                Takes a Minor Injury, which the GM narrates.
        On a failure:
            The GM narrates the foe’s successful action.
            On a margin of 0 or 1: the character takes a Minor Injury, which the GM narrates.
            On a higher margin, the character takes a Major Injury, which the GM narrates.
            The GM notes the player’s margin, truncating margins of 4 or more to 3, and underlining them.
            The GM incorporates the player’s margin into the group’s running total and announces it.
            If it is greater than 0, the players narrate a situation in which they have the upper hand.
            Otherwise, the GM narrates a situation in which the foes have the upper hand.
        When all players have acted, consult the final margin.
        If more than 0:
            Players whose characters scored margins of 0 or more describe the group achieving its chosen objective.
            Players whose margins were truncated choose to: 
                Gain a Push.
                Refresh a General ability other than Fighting.
        If less than 0, the GM describes their failure to achieve the objective, possibly including the circumstances preventing the victorious foe from killing the surviving PCs.

## Define Objectives

Define the objective of each side. 

The GM chooses for the opposition.

Players confer to choose their collective objective. If they fail to agree, and any player chooses kill, that’s the objective.

Common objectives are:
* **Kill**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side of the fight is dead.
* **Render Helpless**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side of the fight is too hurt to continue. Helpless opponents remain on the scene. You may take them prisoner or depart as they roll around on the ground in pain. Killing helpless people, or intelligent creatures, generally requires Stability tests (baseline Difficulty of 6) to avoid Shock. **Minor**: A Crossed Line; **Major**: Out of Control.
* **Gain Surrender**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side agrees to be taken into custody, in exchange for a promise of fair treatment. Not all combatants will willingly surrender. When they don’t, the GM treats the situation as if the players have chosen the Render Helpless objective.
* **Beat Up**: Thrash your opponents and walk away, leaving them badly hurt but not dead.
* **Block**: Stop your opponents from moving past you.
* **Drive Away**: Keep fighting until everyone on the other side retreats. If they were attacking you, they flee back to wherever they came from. If they were defending a position, they flee in random directions or back toward the nearest position of safety. Use when you want to defeat your enemy without killing or capturing them.
* **Escape**: Flee to a position of safety the enemy is not attempting to hold or protect. Can use the **Fleeing** general ability for this.
* **Escape with a Captive**: Grab a member of the opposing force, then flee with your new captive to a position of safety the enemy is not attempting to hold or protect. Where the enemy group includes combatants of varied ability, you take its weakest or most vulnerable member.
* **Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by a member of the opposing force, then flee with it to a position of safety the enemy is not attemptingto hold or protect. Suitable items include books, weapons, amulets, purses, satchels, and documents.
* **Overrun**: You forcibly move through a group of opponents attempting to block you from going somewhere.
* **Topple**: You knock the target off its feet—which is only worth doing when your enemy stands on a cliffside, on the brink of a raging river, in a precarious rowboat, or in some like situation where a fall will cause a more-than-momentary setback.

The fighting abilities in Trail of Cthulhu are **Firearms, Scuffling, and Weapons**. Each objective has different bonuses or penalties, depending on which fighting ability you are using:
| Ability               | Firearms | Scuffling | Weapons |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|---------|
|          Kill         |    +1    |     -1    |    0    |
|    Render Helpless    |    -1    |     0     |    +1   |
|     Gain Surrender    |    -1    |     0     |    +1   |
|        Beat Up        |    -1    |     0     |    +1   |
|         Block         |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |
|       Drive Away      |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |
| Escape with a Captive |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |
|      Gain an Item     |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |
|        Overrun        |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |
|         Topple        |    -1    |     +1    |    0    |

## Determine Difficulty
The GM (or scenario) defines a Difficulty reflecting the overall strength of the entire opposition, including any tactical advantages or disadvantages they may have in this particular situation. Describe situational modifiers to make shifts feel consistent to players. 

Here is a relative challenge table:

| Relative Challenge       | Difficulty (Escape) | Difficulty (Other) | Difficulty  (Kill) | Toll |
|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------|
| Weak                     | 2                   | 3                  | 3                  | 0    |
| Tough but Outmatched     | 2                   | 3                  | 4                  | 0    |
| Evenly Matched           | 3                   | 4                  | 5                  | 1    |
| Superior                 | 3                   | 4                  | 6                  | 1    |
| Vastly Superior          | 3                   | 6                  | 7                  | 2    |
| Overwhelming             | 4                   | 7                  | 8                  | 3    |
| Too Awful to Contemplate | 5                   | 8                  | 10                 | 4    |


## Opt-Out Penalties
Foe Difficulties assume that the foe has to fight an entire party of PCs. When player characters elect to skip a fight, those who do take part in the battle suffer a -1 Fighting penalty per absent PC. The foe’s Toll increases by 1 for each absent PC.

For further explanation of, and exceptions to, this rule, see [Fighting at Less Than Full Strength](#fighting-at-less-than-full-strength).

## Tolls
The other key game statistic for a foe, listed above, is its Toll.

Even a protagonist who wins a fight sometimes gets banged up along the way. Tolls represent the negligible bumps, scrapes, jars, and jolts investigators sustain as they dish out worse to their enemies. 

Players pay Tolls from any combination of Athletics, a fighting ability, and Health. Characters who can’t or won’t pay the Toll instead take foe’s Minor Injury card.

As you can see from the above table, only the more formidable foes, who will knock you around a bit before you put them down, impose Tolls.

In standard GUMSHOE, the equivalent of a Toll is a Health point loss that leaves you above 0 Health.

You might also compare them to the small hit point losses common to other roleplaying games, like *D&D* and *13th Age*.

## Declare Spends
Ask each player in turn how many points of a single fighting ability they’re spending on the coming test. Players cannot spend from a combination of multiple fighting abilities.

## Determine Order of Action
Players are about to take turns, in the following order:

High spends go first. Players spending 0 points go last.

When two or more players are making the same spend, the ones seated on the left (from your point of view) go before those seated on the right.

    Carrie is spending more than anyone, at 4 points. She goes first.
    Then come the players spending 3, from left to right: Noelle, Gianni, and Tsing.
    Next, Saif, spending 2.
    Finally, comes Ana, spending 1.

In an online game without an apparent seating order,break ties in the order of action in whatever manner you find most intuitive. Alphabetical by player or character name probably works best. Does the platform you’re using create a virtual seating order? Use that.

**ALTERNATE RULE**: Some groups prefer to reverse the order of action, going from lowest to highest spends. This choice values narrative clarity over suspense. It allows players of the characters delivering what are likely to be the finishing blows to describe the definitive actions they take to beat the foe. If they win, that is.

## Players Take Their Turns
**Players take individual turns, in which they:**

Describe what they’re hoping to physically accomplish in the fight.

Make fighting tests.

Compare fighting test results against the foe’s Difficulty number, including applicable modifiers.

**Players who meet or beat the number:**

Describe themselves successfully doing what they set out to do in step 1.

Must either pay the foe’s Toll (if any) or take its Minor Injury card. (A few foes instead deal out Shocks.) TheToll, listed in the foe’s profile, can be paid from any combination of a fighting ability, Athletics, or Health. If they take the Injury, you narrate how they suffer it, based on the card’s title and text

**If they do not meet or beat the number:**

You describe their chosen opponent defeating their attempt.

On a margin of 0 or 1, they take the foe’s Minor Injury card.

On a higher margin, they take the foe’s Major Injury card.

You mark the player’s margin, which may be positive, negative, or zero, under their column in the margin row of the fight tracker. If the margin exceeds 3, it truncates, becoming a 3. Players whose margins are truncated get a special reward at the end, so mark this by underlining any truncated margin.

If other players have already acted, add the player’s margin to the running combined total of all previous margins. Cross out the margin for the last player who acted. Call out the new running margin to the players. 

If it is positive or zero, describe how they are collectively triumphing over their adversaries. Zero indicates that they’re winning by the slimmest of hairs.

If it is negative, describe their enemies taking the upper hand in the fight.

As necessary, throw in bits of narration to keep the sense of threat alive.

If other players have yet to take their turn, return to step 1 with the next player in the order of action.

If this player was the last in the turn order, move to the next stage.

## Name the Victors

When the last player has acted, their entry in the “Total” row becomes the final group margin.

If it meets or beats 0, the group scores a victory and achieves its declared goal. Invite players with margins higher than 0 to describe the actions they perform to definitively achieve it. Go from highest to lowest margin, breaking ties from low to high spend, then seating order. 

Did everyone get a 0? Then everyone narrates.

## Fighting as a Quick Test
On occasion you might rule that a character can achieve an objective by scoring a Fighting success outside of the combat system. The PC might be, for example:
* restraining or knocking out a physically unprepossessing person
* wrenching a pistol from someone intent on self-harm
* hunting a game animal

Treat this as you would any other General test.

## Special Cases, Exceptions, and Explanations

### Fighting at Less than Full Strength
The Relative Challenge of foes is calculated assuming that they’re taking on a full group of PCs.

Weaker members of a group may be tempted to sit out a battle and let those with higher Fighting pools take all the risk.

This is not a smart move: it gives the enemy a numbers advantage.

Even a single foe capable of taking on many heroes will have an easier time against three investigators than it would against four, and easier still against only two adversaries.

This is how fights work in any roleplaying game: a dragon has an easier time against a fighter and a cleric than she would against a fighter, a cleric, a wizard, and a rogue. 

When player characters elect to skip a fight, those who do take part in the battle receive a -1 Fighting penalty per absent comrade. The foe’s Toll increases by 1 for each absent PC. This reflects the added challenge and costs of fighting while short-handed.

GMs may choose to ignore the penalty for fighting at less than full strength when it seems punitive or contrary to story logic. Apt times to waive the penalty include:
* When the party is at less than full strength due to circumstances contrived by the GM. If the group splits up and half of them get in a tussle with drunken rival students, or attacked by yeth-hounds, describe only enough adversaries to threaten half the group, and ignore the penalty.(In group vs. group melees, the number of foes you describe is a matter of atmosphere and description. It can be higher or greater than the size of the PC group without impacting the game mechanics.)
* When players (as opposed to their characters) are absent.
* When a character is not just unwilling but unable to fight due to the effects of a completely debilitating Shock or Injury card.

The GM need never waive the penalty when players bend the story out of shape to justify fighting at less than full strength.

When you waive the penalty, and another fight against the same enemy occurs later, you may need to describe countervailing changes in the situation to explain why she seems just as effective against a larger force of PCs. More likely, with die results andspends adding variance to the outcome, no one will notice or care.

(In bookkeeping terms, it’s simpler to increase the foe’s Difficulty number by the number of missing combatants than to ask players to calculate penalties. A few players find this confusing on a conceptual level, though. It feels to them that it’s the foes who are becoming more or less powerful, as opposed to the PCs’ force becoming relatively weaker as its numbers diminish. If your players don’t have a problem with it, use this simpler option instead.)

### Support Actions
When players ask if they can do things in combat other than make Fighting tests, answer by revealing these rules. This delayed introduction simplifies the combat system’s learning curve. Support actions give players more choices, at the cost of additional complexity and rules consultation.

Characters can elect to take a **support action**, contributing to others’ success in combat instead of taking on the enemy directly.

Players taking support actions can hold their actions, inserting themselves into the Fighting order when their help appears to be needed. They test the ability they’re substituting for Fighting against the foe’s Difficulty.

**On a failure**, the character taking the support action:
* takes a Minor Injury (if margin is 0 or 1) or a Major Injury (if margin is 2 or more)
* pays the foe’s Toll
* subtracts the margin from the group’s combat total

**On a success**, the character gains the benefit corresponding to the chosen type of support action:

* First Aid: When any one other character is assigned an Injury card, you may choose for it  to be discarded before it is received (in the case of a Minor Injury card) or (in the case of a Major Injury) downgraded to a Minor Injury.
* Athletics: Draw fire to yourself and away from a comrade. When another character is assigned an Injury card, you may choose to take that card instead. Restricted to one beneficiary per combat.
* Stability (if the goal is Gain Surrender): Grant a bonus to any one comrade’s Fighting test. +1 if your margin is 1 or less; +2 if your margin is 2 or more. As with any bonus, this applies before the test is made.
* Psychoanalysis: When any one other character is assigned a Shock card, cause it to be discarded before it is received (in the case of a Minor Shock card) or (in the caseof a Major Shock) downgraded to a Minor Shock. (Applies only to foes that dish out Shock cards in combat instead of Injury cards.)
* Explosives: Soften up the foe with a grenade or other small explosive device. Allows one character of your choice making a Fighting test to roll two dice, picking the best one and ignoring the other. If you fail your test, you do not take an Injury card. Instead, your exploding device hurts someone on your own side. Choose another PC taking part in the fight to receive an Injury—Light Shrapnel if your margin is 1 or less; Shrapnel if the margin is 2 or more. 
* Firearms (Full Auto): *Writer's Note: Not actually sure how to model this in QuickShock. Open to suggestions!*

### Reinforcements
When they want to solve a problem by fighting a challenging opponent, player characters often look for other people to suffer and die in their place.

This rarely works for characters in horror stories—or in more heroic genres, for that matter. Expect it to be just as hard to pull off here.

When the GM does reckon that your attempt to recruit cannon fodder makes sense within the story, those additional fighters don’t count as full combatants the way player characters do.Instead, the GM reduces the Difficulty of your Fighting tests, reflecting the assistance of  reinforcements.

Or she may decide that the presence of reinforcements discourages your enemies, preventing a fight altogether

### Imagining Combat
***What are the limits on what I can describe when narrating my character’s Fighting success?***

If you succeeded, have fun inventing imaginative and vivid visual descriptions of your contribution to the fight. You could calibrate your description to your margin, with 0 or 1 representing a small contribution; 2, something impressive but just short of decisive; and 3, an over-the-top example of thrilling triumph. Or just say what comes to mind and fits your character and the situation. Other than that, feel free to use maximum creative license. In the very unlikely event that your description contradicts a fact about the mystery or world that the GM understands as crucial to the rest of the story, she’ll suggest an amended version of your proposed narration that preserves that essential plot point.

***Why do we have to act in descending spend order?***

This introduces suspense, keeping openthe question of whether the group will succeed to the maximum extent possible. We know the high-spenders are likely to succeed, but what about those relying mostly on the luck of the die?

***What if we go in ascending spend order?***

This makes no mechanical difference, so if that makes better sense to your group, you can change that up without unpleasant surprises.

***What happens when investigators join a fight in waves?***

The GM alters the order of action so that you make Fighting tests in the order in which you join the fight. Assuming you had no time to collectively decide on a group goal beforehand, late joiners have to go along with the goal chosen by the first character(s) to enter the fight.

***Can we switch our goal if the situation changes in mid-fight?***

This will happen less often than you might think, but sure. If the entire group agrees, you can switch to a new goal when you describe your final victory, provided it carries an equal or less costly Difficulty number than the originally chosen goal.

***We spend too much time deciding on our group goal.***

That’s less a question than a statement, but we’ll allow it. If this remains an issue for your group, expect your GM to remedy it by suggesting the most obvious choice and guiding the discussion to a quick resolution.

***We don’t want to pick a goal; we want our characters charge in at cross-purposes and describe what our characters are doing tactically. Strategy is for suckers, man!***

Groups devoted to this style of play will have a better experience by reverting from QuickShock to standard GUMSHOE. Notes on how to do this may be available on the Pelgrane website by the time you read this.

***I have 2 Injury cards, both describing pretty minor conditions. How can that put my character on the brink of death?***

You’re not on the brink of death at all. You’re ever so slightly off your game—in a way that might tip the balance between survival and funeral arrangements the next time you face a dangerous situation. Think of the last time you had a really bad cold or flu, or when you last pulled a back muscle or hurt yourself in some other painful but minor way. Then imagine yourself in that state when you need to steer your car clear of a pile-up or jump out of the way of a collapsing store display. That extra drag on your awareness and ability to react is what your cards in hand represent—nothing if you stay out of trouble, but potentially disastrous if you don’t.

Also remember that when you receive a Final Injury card, you describe a demise that best fits the situation, whether it matches the card concept or not.

Players steeped in classic roleplaying games like D&D and Call of Cthulhu may want to describe QuickShock GUMSHOE characters as having three hit points apiece. This conceptualization will confuse more than it clarifies, so shoot it down if someone brings it up. Injuries are status effects. You’re not one-third or one-quarter dead on a single Injury, two-thirds or half dead on another, and then dead.

Think of it as “off your game,” “vulnerable,” and then dead (**Purist**) or “off your game,” “vulnerable,” “really shouldn’t be fighting now,” and dead (**Pulp**). 

Tolls are the closest thing QuickShock GUMSHOE has to hit points, but even there the analogy doesn’t entirely track.

***What does the GM do if the foe’s goal is something other than kill, and its Injury card seems out of place for that less aggressive objective?***

In most cases the foe still has to rough you up somewhat to get what it wants. The GM may choose to substituteother Injuries more fitting to the circumstances. In a pinch, the minor/major pairing of “You Should See the Other Fellow” and “Concussed” fit most non-lethal foe objectives.

## When Player Characters Fight
We’re tucking these rules here in our final appendix, as you’ll need them rarely if ever. Ordinarily a physical struggle between members of the main cast tells you that the story has gone seriously sideways. 

Still, in horror stories the protagonists now and then have to square off against each other. They might get possessed, suffer perceptual delusions, or be forced to do battle in a death-trap filled basement.

When threat of PC vs. PC violence sparks from a player choice, warn the one escalating to fratricidal violence that the system favors the sympathetic defender over the murderous aggressor—as stories tend to do when protagonists come to blows.

### Aggressor and Defender

Based on the events narrated by the group so far, the GM identifies which characters are the aggressors and which the defenders.

This becomes obvious in context: the character or group of characters who escalate from talking to fighting are the aggressors. Those being attacked are the defenders.

In the oddball case when both seem to start the fight at the same moment, choose the side with the player most responsible for steering the story to this point. If that doesn’t make sense either, ask an involved player to roll a die. On an even roll, treat that player’s side as defenders. On an odd result, they’re the attackers.

Usually fights have one aggressor and one defender. Scraps featuring multiple player characters on one or both sides happen less often. It is conceivable that supporting characters may take part on one or both sides as well, though their effect on the outcome is indirect.

### Define Objectives

The aggressor(s) starts by defining an objective, drawing from a slightly adjusted version of the familiar list:

* **Kill**: Kill all defenders.
* **Render Helpless**: Render defenders helpless and unable to escape for the time being. Killing helpless comrades requires an extremely tougher Stability test to avoid lasting trauma.
* **Block**: Stop defenders from moving past you.
* **Drive Away**: Keep fighting until the defenders retreat, leaving you safely in control of your current position.
* An aggressor can’t select **Escape** as an objective. Until the aggressor starts a fight, the defenders are not a threat to escape from.
* **Escape with a Captive**: Grab a defender, then flee to a position of safety no one else is attempting to hold or protect. Pick the defender you want to grab.
* **Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by a defender, then flee with it to a position of safety where defenders can’t interfere with you.
* **Overrun**: Get past the defenders, who are physically standing in your way.

Then the defending side defines objectives:
* **Kill**: Kill all aggressors. (An unlikely but possible choice.)
* **Render Helpless**: Render aggressors helpless and in your custody. Killing helpless comrades requires an extremely tougher Composure test to avoid lasting trauma.
* **Block**: Stop aggressors from moving past you.
* **Drive Away**: Keep fighting until the aggressors are forced to retreat.
* **Escape**: Disengage from, or avoid engagement with, the aggressors, evading any ensuing pursuit.
* **Escape with a Captive**: Grab a defender, then flee to a position of safety no one else is attempting to hold or protect. Pick the defender you want to grab. Available only against multiple aggressors; otherwise, choose either Render Helpless or Escape.
* **Gain an Item**: Grab a portable, easily seized item held by an aggressor, then flee with it to a position of safety where aggressors can’t interfere with you.
  
### Specify Weapons
Ask each character to specify the weapons they’re using, if any.

### Assign Difficulties
The base Difficulties for the upcoming Fighting tests start at 4.

Add 2 to the Difficulty for characters fighting to Kill.

Where one side is outnumbered, subtract the number of combatants on the outnumbered side from the number they’re fighting, and add it to the outnumbered side’s Difficulty.

If the GM can see from story context that one side should have an advantage over the other, the disadvantaged group adds 1-2 points to its Difficulty target, with 1 reflecting a detectable advantage and 2 a glaringly significant one.

### Make Fighting Tests
All combatants make fighting tests.

### Identify the Victor
When all aggressors fail their tests, the defenders attain their objective, even if all defenders also failed.

When everyone fails, a stalemate results and no one attains their objectives. Both sides suffer embarrassment and possible minor harm, but are unable to resolve their conflict with force.

When at least one aggressor succeeds, the GM asks for each participant’s margin. Add margins for successful combatants to the total for their side, while subtracting margins for characters who failed their tests. Compare the total margins for each side. If the defenders’ total equals or exceeds the aggressors, the defenders win and attain their objectives. Otherwise, the aggressors win and attain theirs.

### Check for Injuries
If a side attained its objective and the objective was Kill, all characters on the losing side make Difficulty 6 Health tests. On a success, the character takes a Major Injury. On a failure, the character immediately dies. A character with two Injuries already in hand will die no matter what, rendering the test redundant.

Losers against opponents who were not trying to Kill take Minor Injuries if they succeeded at Fighting and Major Injuries if they failed. As always, a Final Injury card kills.

Regardless of objective, members of the winning side must pay a Toll of 3, from any combination of Fighting, Athletics, and Health, to avoid injury. Those declining to pay the Toll take a Major Injury if they failed their Fighting tests, and a Minor Injury if they succeeded.

Injuries vary according to the weapons used by the victim’s opponents.

When opponents used differing weapons, the GM decides which one dishes out the Injury. Choose according to the logic of the situation you’ve all described, the weapon wielded by the opponent with the highest test result, or arbitrarily, if no obvious answer presents itself. 

* **Unarmed**: Bruised/Battered
* **Knife**: Nicked/Stabbed
* **Blunt Instrument**: Seeing Stars/Dented Skull
* **Sword/Other Large Blade**: Superficial Laceration/Run Through
* **Gun**: Powder Burn/GSW
  
### Narrate Results
Knowing who won, and who got injured, guide the players to describe what happens. Invite the aggressors to describe what they’re doing first, then the defenders, then have the victors (if any) lay out the fight’s end conditions.

When multiple characters fight on a single side, start the narration with failed tests first, then move on to the successes.

### Stability Tests
Use this step only if one or more player characters died in the fight.

All participants make Difficulty 6 Stability tests, with the following modifiers:
* +2 for each dead character after thefirst 
* +1 for aggressors, regardless of who died 
* an additional +1 for aggressors, if one or more defenders died 
* +1 for defenders, if aggressors died 
* -2 if aggressors were possessed or otherwise did not choose to attack

Successful tests result in a Minor Shock. Failures get a Major Shock. Aggressors and defenders get different shocks.

**Aggressors**: Blood Debt/Fratricide
**Defenders**: I Should Have Prevented This/Spiral into Violence

### Quick Reference
PC vs. PC Quick Reference

1. GM identifies aggressor.
2. Define objectives:
   1. Aggressor: Kill, Render Helpless, Block, Drive Away, Escape with Captive, Gain an Item, Overrun.
   2. Defender: Kill, Render Helpless, Block, Drive Away, Escape, Escape with Captive, Gain an Item.
3. Combatants specify weapons.
4. GM assigns Difficulties: Base 4, +2 if fighting to Kill; +1 per additional combatant if outnumbered; +1 to +3 for situational modifiers if disadvantaged.
5. All combatants make Fighting tests.
6. GM uses their results to identify the victor (if any):
   1. All aggressors fail = defender wins.
   2. Everyone fails = stalemate.
   3. Otherwise, side with highest total margin wins.
7. Participants check for Injuries.
   1. Losers whose opponents were fighting to Kill make Difficulty 6 Health tests,taking Major Injuries on success or dying on failure.
   2. Losers whose opponents weren’t fighting to Kill take Major Injuries if their Fighting tests failed and Minor Injuries if they succeeded.
   3. Victors pay a Toll of 3 or take a Major Injury if they failed their Fighting tests, or a Minor Injury if they succeeded.
8. The group narrates the fight.
9. If anyone died, survivors make Stability tests. Base Difficulty 6, +2 for each dead character after the first; +1 for aggressors, regardless of who died; an additional +1 for aggressors, if one or more defenders died; +1 for defenders, if aggressors died; -2 if aggressors were possessed or otherwise did not choose to attack.
