# Shocks and Injuries
When characters are physically harmed or undergo mental shocks, they gain cards reflecting the harm they suffer.

Depending on what you all find convenient, your GM may choose to give you:
* physical cards, in the form of slips of paper printed out from PDF andhanded to you
* virtual cards; check pelgranepress.com for our most up-to-date tools for digital card dealing

Whatever the form factor, the game uses the language of playing cards to describe how you handle them. When you gain an Injury or Shock, you add it to your hand. When you get rid of it, you discard it. You sometimes trade one card for another—most often a really bad shock or injury for a less bad one.

Text on the cards is exceptions-based, meaning that when the card text contradicts another game rule, it takes precedence over the general rules.

Discard all cards at the end of each scenario, with the exception of cards marked **Continuity**. Any card without this tag, and without an explicit discard condition, is discarded at the end of a scenario.

Most cards tell you what you have to do to get rid of them during a session. They may simply indicate that you have to pay a price or overcome an obstacle, leaving the details of that up to you to weave into the story, and the GM to approve. If it feels like something that would credibly get rid of the problem in a story or TV show, the GM approves it.

When an Injury card lists a First Aid Difficulty, another character with that ability can get rid of the card for you by successfully making that test.

Some cards allow you to fulfill conditions, like spending General points or Pushes, to discard the card. In certain cases you can do this only after a specified time has elapsed. Where no time is specified, you can get rid of the card immediately, suffering no ill effect other than the expenditure.

You may be tempted to make cards gained during the final scene of a scenario Continuity cards, on the grounds that their cool effects will otherwise never come into play. Though that makes some sense on a theoretical level, in practice you’ll find this option too punitive. It can put charactersin a death spiral right from the start of a new mystery. Instead, accept that cards given out in what turns out to be a concluding scene only matter if they become Final cards.

Examples of Injury and Shock cards can be found in the [GUMSHOE SRD](https://site.pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/files/GUMSHOE_SRD_CC_3.pdf).

## Mythos Shocks
When taking a Minor Shock from a Mythos encounter, your Sanity rating is reduced by 1. If it's a Major Shock, it's reduced by 2.

This penalty can only be suffered once (the most severe) per scenario.

## Death and Incapacity
A character dies and leaves play for good after receivingtoo many Injury cards.

A character suffers irreparable mental strain and leaves play (played by the GM if the character appears again at all) after receiving too many Shock cards.

In Purist mode, too many = 3. The third card in either category you take is called your Final card.

In Pulp mode, too many = 4. The fourth card in either category you take is called your Final card.

On a Final Injury card, the GM invites you to describe a suitable death, given the circumstances that led to your gaining that fatal third card. You might:
* take inspiration from the situation currently being narrated
* describe an even worse version of the harm implied by the title and effects of the Final card.
* describe a fatal worsening of a condition suggested by a previous Injury card already in hand.

Likewise, as soon as you have three Shock cards in hand, your character loses all grip on reality.

You might:
* take inspiration from the situation currently being narrated.
* describe an even worse version of the emotional or perceptual break implied by the title and effects of the Final card.
* describe a condition suggested by a previous Shock card already in hand shattering the character’s psyche.

This could be followed up with a suggestion of the character’s eventual fate: commitment to a sanitarium, becoming a shut-in kept in the family attic back in Westchester, loping off into the woods to live as a hermit, or the like. Depending on where the characters are when you take the Final card, you might describe this right away, or after an appropriate break in the action. In some instances the GM may wish to reserve the right to treat the now-unbalanced character as an antagonist, ongoing or otherwise.

After the narration ensuing from a Final card, the player creates a new character.

If you hear a player conclude that their characters only have three (or four) hit points, they’re setting themselves up for confusion and annoyance, as that’s not how this rules set thinks. Head off that conceptual stumbling block by providing the explanation in the [Fighting](04.Fighting.md) section. 

**Unrule**: Unlike standard GUMSHOE, your Stability and Health pools never directly determine whether you remain in play. You never drop below 0 in those pools.

## Card Terms
As a shorthand certain cards use standard terms, defined here.
* **+x to Tolls**: The character holding the card treats foes as if their Tolls are a specified number of points higher. Tolls for characters not holding such cards do not increase.
* **Discard**: Unless otherwise specified, the instruction “discard” applies to the card the text appears on.
* **GMC**: A character run by the Game Moderator.
* **A night’s sleep**: The character must gain a solid night’s sleep in circumstances not much less safe and comfortable than she would be used to during her ordinary, non-mystery investigating life. (Requiring a good night’s sleep from the player, as opposed to the character, would be weird even for this game.)
* **Nonlethal**: Cannot be your Final card. If received when you are one short of the Final card in its category, youtake the card and undergo its effects, if any, but your character does not leave play. However, a nonlethal card **does** count toward you total when you have it in hand already and another incoming card becomes your Final card.
* **Pay a price**: When you suffer a significant negative consequence to bring about a situation that allows you to discard a card. GM decides what “significant” means.
* **Recipient**: When one character performs a test or spends to benefit another, the character receiving the benefit is the recipient. When a card says you must be the recipient of a success or spend to discard a card, your character may not perform the action; any other PC can.
* **Take a risk**: You perform an action that stands a decent chance of getting you into real trouble, as judged by the GM.

When card text tells you that you lose a number of points, your pool drops by that number. If you have fewer pool points than the card specifies, your pool drops to 0.

You might receive a card that costs you a number of points you don’t have and therefore can't pay. In that case, count yourself lucky: you’re off the hook! The GM does not swap your card for a different one to ensure that you suffer some other disadvantage. Having a Shock or Injury card is bad news all by itself, even if you can shrug off its specific ill effect.

## Hazards

Dangers faced outside of combat are called hazards. Hazards can be physical or mental.

### Physical Hazards
Physical hazards can be avoided, or their effects minimized, by making Athletics or Health tests. 

Athletics tests apply when harm can be avoided with a quick dodge or other overt, intentional defensive action. Examples include:
* falling from a great height•ducking flying debris
* leaping out of the way of a plummeting object
* swimming in a dangerous current
* leaping over a chasm or between buildings
* rushing from a flaming building without getting burned

Health tests happen in passive situations where you are exposed to a physical danger and the question that remains is how badly it affects you. This applies to instances of:
* poisoning
* sickness
* exposure
  
The GM may also call for Health tests when the character has had no chance to actively evade a danger that would otherwise call for an Athletics test. For example, if doused in kerosene and set alight while helpless, a Health test might determine whether the character suffers severe burns, or merely loses some hair and perhaps an eyebrow or two.

Each physical hazard threatens a Minor or a Major Injury, depending on the test result. Characters who succeed are unaffected. On a failure by a margin of 2 or more, they take Major Injury cards. On a failure with a margin of 0 or 1, they take Minor Injury cards.

**COMMON MISREADING WARNING! COMMON MISREADING WARNING!** For some deep cognitive reason possibly indicating past exposure to a vast, inky alien lake, your brain may want you to remember the above, incorrectly, as success = Minor Injury, failure = Major Injury. That error will death-spiral your characters right quick.

To repeat, the correct rule is: **Success = no Injury; Failure (margin 0–1) = Minor Injury; Failure (margin 2+) = Major Injury**

### Mental Hazards

Mental hazards require characters to make Stability tests.

On a **success**, the character does not take a Shock card.

On a **failure** with a margin of **0 or 1**, the character takes the Minor Shock card.

On a **failure** with a margin of **2 or more**, the character takes the Major Shock card.

AGAIN, DON’T LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN if it tells you to dole out a Minor card on a success and a Major on a failure.
