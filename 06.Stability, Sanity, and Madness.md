# Stability, Sanity, and Madness

The sections on **Experience and Stability, Drives and Stability, Losing Sanity, Lost Sanity and Drives, Avoiding Sanity Loss, Denial, and Fainting** are retained from the ToC book (p.72 -76).

The section on **Mental Illness** (p. 77-79) is ignored.

**Mythos Shocks** (p. 74) are reworked in the [Shocks and Injuries](./06.Shocks%20and%20Injuries.md) section.

**Cthulhu Mythos Ability Use** (p. 74) and **Pillars of Sanity** (p. 46), **Sources of Stability** (p. 48), and **Damaging Pillars of Sanity** (p. 75) can optionally be superseded by the [Revised Pillars of Sanity Rules by Tony Williams](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/revised-pillars-of-sanity-rules/).

## Cthulhu Mythos

Unlike other Investigative abilities, Cthulhu Mythos still has a rating. Points can be spent to use Cthulhu Mythos.

If using the alternate rules, using Cthulhu Mythos incurs a Stability check (standard difficulty of 5). A success will incur a Minor Shock, while a failure will incur a Major Shock. Regardless of the result of the check, using Cthulhu Mythos may incur Sanity loss depending on the nature of the knowledge gained (baseline 1 for a Minor Shock, 2 for a Major Shock). The difficulty of the stability check will also depend on the nature of the knowledge gained.

## Mythos Tomes
Tomes function as described in the **Tomes** section of the ToC rulebook (p.104-105).

## Spells
Spells for players can be converted from ToC (p. 109-112) with the following guidelines:
Keep the Stability test. Replace the Cost with Minor and Major Shocks. Failing the test will incur a Minor Shock, succeeding will incur a Major Shock. If the spell as written has a Sanity cost, take half the cost on a fail, and the full cost on a success.

Spells could alternatively function similar to those in [Black Star Magic](https://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/black-star-magic/), where Spells are Shock Cards that have some discard condition.
